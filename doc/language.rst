Language for Distributed Programs
===================================

DistZero's embedded language for defining distributed programs.
Ultimately, end users will produce a program defined by `dist_zero.expression.Expression` instances,
and DistZero will compile and run it.

.. automodule:: dist_zero.reactive.expression
   :members:

.. automodule:: dist_zero.types
   :members:

.. automodule:: dist_zero.primitive
